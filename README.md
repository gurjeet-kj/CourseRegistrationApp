Course Registration App - Android :  Description

The International College wants to offer the students a list of courses and give them the ability to register these courses.
And they hire you to create a mobile application to do the following:
Let the user enter their name
And 2 choices: graduated, and ungraduated
A menu of 5 courses which are: Java, Swift, iOS, Android, Database The fees for each course in the sequence: 1300, 1500, 1350, 1400, 1000 The hours/week for each course in the sequence: 6,5,5,7,4
Once the user selects the course name must see the course fees and hours
The user can add a course so add the course fees to totalFees, and course hours to totalHours. Display both of them.
The student can add multiple courses but if graduated then can have 21 hours maximum, and 19 hours maximum if ungraduated.
Every time the student tries to add a course , make sure the course is not already added and they will not exceed the maximum number of allowed hours, if yes then show a message that says “you can’t add this course”. 
The student can choose one or both or none of  2 options: Accommodation, Medical Insurance.
The cost is 1000$ for accommodation, and 700$ for Medical Insurance
